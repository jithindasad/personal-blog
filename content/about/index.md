## Hey, I'm Jithin  ,

> Welcome to my personal repository of random ramblings.

I live in [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala#/media/File:ThrissurPooram-Kuda.jpg), India. ~~and currently working remotely as a software engineer at [BigBinary](https://www.bigbinary.com/)~~

I quit my job in January 2022 to build **Doom Chat** [WIP]. An Open Core alternative to Slack, Discord et..

I donâ€™t [call myself a programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) but I like the idea of making a software out of my closet that would some day pay my bills and use my programming abilities as a tool to hack towards that goal.

Apart from this I love reading books [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108741351-jithin-das) and bugging my little sister.
