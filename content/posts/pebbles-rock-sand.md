Today I came across an interesting article which forced me to re-think the way I'm going forward with building [doom chat](https://www.doom.chat/). The article is called "**[Big Rocks, Pebbles and Sand - How to manage it all?](https://getmarlow.com/article/big-rocks-pebbles-sand---how-to-manage-it-all-1563899084731x981090384055894000)**"

It's an interesting theory, TLDR; here is the premise:

Let's say you have an empty glass jar and you are given some big rocks, pebbles, and a bucket of sand. You should fill the empty jar with these 3 items in such a way that it should make use of the maximum capacity the jar can offer.

Now the obvious question, is which Item should go first?

Answer: **Rocks!**

Then the pebbles go next and the sand at the end.

Even though it's just a simple story, It has a very valuable lesson inside it when it comes to prioritizing your tasks. We should Identify our Rocks, Pebbles, and Sand before blindly hacking towards an end goal.

I have put together a small framework with the help of [Eisenhower-matrix](https://evernote.com/blog/work-effectively-with-the-eisenhower-matrix) to identify the Rocks, Pebbles, and Sand of our environment.

### <span style="color:red;">Quadrant 1</span> â€“ "Do it immediately"

These are the tasks and to-dos that need immediate attention. 

### <span style="color:yellow;">Quadrant 2</span> â€“ "Decide when youâ€™ll do it"

You have to be strategic about this section of the matrix, perfect for long-term development. Items that belong here are important, but they do not require your immediate attention.

### <span style="color:green;">Quadrant 3</span> â€“ "Delegate to somebody else"

These types of tasks usually donâ€™t warrant your attention because they donâ€™t produce measurable output.

### <span style="color:grey;">Quadrant 4</span> â€“ "Do it later"

The time-wasters that prevent us from accomplishing the more urgent and important tasks in the first two quadrants.

This will be the chosen framework for prioritizing product development at [doom chat](https://www.doom.chat/) from now on!

An interesting way of implementing this can be by creating **4 labels** (<span style="color:red;">P1</span>, <span style="color:yellow;">P2</span>, <span style="color:green;">P3</span>, <span style="color:gray;">P4</span>) to represent 4 quadrants and using a tool like Trello for todos with appropriate labels attached, Add this to your regular SCRUM and you now have a nice framework for prioritizing your org's tasks. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Thanks and Have a nice day!  <span><code>:wave:</code></span>
